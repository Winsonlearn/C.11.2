# Python Web Development Project

This repository contains a series of web development projects using Python, focusing on different aspects of web development and database integration.

## Project Structure

### MEET Folders
Each MEET folder represents a different web development project:

#### MEET00
- Basic Flask web application setup
- Contains:
  - `main.py`: Main application file
  - `static/`: Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images)
  - `templates/`: HTML templates
  - `.venv/`: Python virtual environment

#### MEET01
- Flask web application with enhanced features
- Contains:
  - `main.py`: Main application file
  - `static/`: Static files
  - `templates/`: HTML templates

#### MEET02
- Flask web application with additional functionality
- Contains:
  - `main.py`: Main application file
  - `static/`: Static files
  - `templates/`: HTML templates
  - `.venv/`: Python virtual environment

#### MEET03
- Advanced Flask web application
- Contains:
  - `main.py`: Main application file with more complex functionality
  - `static/`: Static files
  - `templates/`: HTML templates

### SQL Folder
Contains SQL-related projects and exercises:

#### SQL/1
- Basic SQL exercises and examples

#### SQL/project
- SQL project work and implementations

## Getting Started

1. Each MEET folder contains its own virtual environment (`.venv`)
2. To run any project:
   ```bash
   cd MEETXX  # Replace XX with the meeting number
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment
   python main.py  # Run the application
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- SQL-related dependencies (for SQL projects)

## Note
Each project is self-contained and can be run independently. Make sure to activate the virtual environment before running any project.
